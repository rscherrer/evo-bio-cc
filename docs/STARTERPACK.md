# Starter Pack

This is a proposed starter pack for lecturers or new (and old) members of the team.

(Keep it up-to-date.)

Welcome on board!

The [Crash Course](https://evobiocrashcourse.github.io/) is a series of free online lectures and practicals dedicated to students with a biology background and who would like to get a pre-Master's level in the field of evolutionary biology. The course is run by a team of volunteers, mostly grad students, in various sub-fields of evolutionary sciences, and based all over the world.

The course usually takes place at the end of spring on in the summer, over a span of two weeks. Each day there is a schedule comprising lectures, practicals and Q&A sessions. There is a mix of live sessions (using Zoom) and pre-recorded stuff (many lectures are) and so, the students do not need to follow exactly at the recommended time and can essentially go through the course at their own pace, except for the live sessions. This is especially useful if students are in different time zones than the teachers. That said, every live session should be recorded, such that the students can always go back to the content if they missed something. The content should all be available to the students in a common storage (e.g. Google Drive), that they may also be able to access after the end of the course. For the pre-recorded stuff we try to provide some captions, including translated ones, as much as possible (so, feel very welcome to provide captions or subtitles in any language you know if you contribute some recorded stuff). We coordinate the course on Slack, where we organize the workspace in multiple channels specializing on each of the modules in the course. We also make sure to send daily announcements to the students and answer technical questions as often as possible, while the course is running. We meet regularly to discuss progress and things to do in preparation for the next session (e.g. final schedule). There should be a [countdown](COUNTDOWN.md) of things to do in the period running up to the next edition. As a team member you should also have been added to our WhatsApp group.

Great to have you among us!
