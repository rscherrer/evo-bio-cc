# Suggestions

Here are my recommendations for what could be improved in further editions (last edition was the 2024 one).

Check [this page](docs/HOMEWORK.md) out for my own homework.

## Schedule

The classes should be given in a specific order. For example, quantitative genetics should come after population genetics, which should come after the introduction to population genetics. Theory sessions such as adaptive dynamics and the philosophy of modeling should come after those too. The practical on sexual selection should come after both the lecture on the philosophy of models and the one on sexual selection. The practical on quantitative genetics should come before the lecture on quantitative genetics but after the ones on population genetics. The practical on population genetics should come before quantitative genetics. Speciation should definitely come after (population and quantitative) genetics and sexual selection, and should come before adaptive dynamics. Also make sure that practicals and Q&A are not too close together to their respective lectures?

Suggestion 1: This set of rules could be saved somewhere, and augmented by each lecturer so we can refer to it as a checklist when going over and validating the schedule.

Suggestion 2: Have a deadline for when the final schedule must be ready. That deadline may be in the general countdown (see General).

## Storage

The shared drive was problematic this year. Make sure all of the content is accessible in one place, and make sure that storage is operational ahead of time. We had many complaints this year about not having the content in one place.

Suggestion 3: Have a deadline for checking and testing the storage aheady of time.

## Meetings

Suggestion 4: Give admin rights to all lecturers and people who run Q&A sessions ahead of time. Test the general Zoom meeting ahead of time so everybody knows how to use it.

What do we do in case of lost connection?

Suggestion 5: Two admins logged in at every session would be nice. (So there is a back-up host if needed, but also because it makes Q&A sessions more lively.)

## Practicals

Suggestion 6: Practials should be self-contained and hosted on GitHub or some shared storage so that the students can easily access them without having to wait for the files to be shared.

Suggestion 7: Add R and RStudio practicals back into the game.

Suggestion 8: Make sure that all practicals come with answers (as much as possible), so students can review their own progress even if they cannot follow the Q&A session?

## Attendence

Suggestion 9: Have a deadline for when the forms or whichever mode of attendence checking/evaluation should be ready to go. 

Suggestion 10: So we can also have an early announcement in the first week of the course about attendence.

## Translations

We need to sort out how translations are shared depending on whether the video content is hosted online or not.

## General

Suggestion 11: Make a [starter pack](docs/STARTERPACK.md) for lecturers: how to make your lectures, captions, how to share recordings (e.g. use Zoom cloud), how the course generally works, etc.

Suggestion 12: Is it possibe to give admin status to some people on Slack? Also fix the trial period thing. Maybe a channel only for admins?

Suggestion 13: Have a general [countdown](docs/COUNTDOWN.md) with a checklist of deadlines to meet as we approach the start date of the course.

Suggestion 14: Have a permanent Slack for us to prepare the Crash Course?

Suggestion 15: Teams and team leaders.

Suggestion 16: More efficient navigation to important documents, forms and spreadsheets (possibly including READMEs or starter packs to indicate where to find stuff).

## Content

Ideas for possible new content:

* Maybe a new lecture on the species concept (or a mini clip?)
* Maybe a practical on building your own simulation. With examples in R, Python, C++. Could use GitHub actions to check the answers.
* Maybe a practical on data wrangling and data analysis? Or is that too much off-topic?
* Maybe a mini clip on introgression and incomplete lineage sorting in phylogenetics
* Maybe a lecture on macro-evolution proper (paleontology, major transitions, stuff like that)
